=================
[mlab.seas.upenn.edu/mlep](http://mlab.seas.upenn.edu/mlep)

MLE+ is an open-source Matlab/Simulink toolbox developed at [mLab](http://mlab.seas.upenn.edu) for co-simulation with the
whole-building energy simulator [EnergyPlus](http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/energyplus/). It is designed for engineers
and researchers who are familiar with Matlab and Simulink and want to use
these software tools in building energy simulation.
